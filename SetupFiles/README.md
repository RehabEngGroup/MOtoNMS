# MOtoNMS: Setup Files #

This folder includes three subdirectories, one for each toolbox step 
that require setup files.

These files are listed in Appendix A of the User Manual and 
describe the laboratory setup, markers and EMG protocols 
(Acquisition Interface), EMG output labels depending on the final 
application (Data Processing), and information for joint center 
computation methods (Static Elaboration).

The meaning of these files and how to create and validate them are described
in the *Setup Files* sections of each chapter of the User Manual.

*xsd* folder includes XML Schema required for the validation procedure described in Appendix B of the User Manual.
