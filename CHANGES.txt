v. 1.0 (February 17, 2014) 

Initial Release


v. 2.0 (May 9, 2014)

NEW FEATURES:
- Support to MATLAB 64 bit and multiplatform (C3D2MAT based on BTK)  
- EMG selection using Analog Labels from each C3D input file
- Shoulder, elbow, and wrist JC computation for static trials, and examples of setup files for Griffith University markerset
- Missing values for markers trajectories identified by NaN instead of 0 in .trc output files
      
CODE CHANGES:
- Added src/shared folder to store functions common to several steps
- Modified filtering of markers trajectories: they are filtered only when visible and only if they have no gaps (DataFiltering.m, ZeroLagButtFiltfilt.m)
- Modified filtering of GRF data from type 1 force platform: filtering is applied only to non zero values to avoid smoothing due to zero values 
 (data from force platform of type 1 are stored in C3D files after thresholding)
- Modified data interpolation: markers trajectories are interpolated only if gaps of consecutive frames are shorter than a fixed number 
  defined according to the video frame rate (DataInterpolation.m)
- Modified retrieval of Analog Data in C3D2MAT: removed assumption of analog data stored only in analog channels subsequent to those dedicated to force data. 
Now they can be stored in any analog channel indipendently from force data.
- Renamed replaceWithNans.m as replaceMissingWithNaNs.m
- Renamed matfiltfilt2.m as ZeroLagButtFiltfilt.m 
- Removed warning messages caused by the lack of subject's first and last names when loading a predefined acquisition.xml 
- Added last selected folder in text fields of graphical user interfaces (GUIs)

BUG FIXES:
- Modified transformation of COP coordinates from local to global reference system: translation added only for non zero values.
- User is not required to set a new identifier each time he/she load an already available elaboration.xml file as in version 1.0.  
- Changed the definition of the interval where markers are visible in replaceMissingWithNaNs.m (the definition of var 'index')
- Fixed the computation of the hip joint center (HJC) with the Harrington method (HJCHarrington.m)


v. 2.1 (September 8, 2014)

NEW FEATURES:

- Compatibility with MacOS X operating systems 
- Envelope plots with normalization scale (% max)
- Plot of normalized EMG linear envelopes for all the muscles
- .sto (OpenSim storage) file format for EMG output 
- .mot (SIMM and OpenSim motion) file format for EMG output (new default)

CODE CHANGES:

- Changed elaboration.xsd to add support of different output file formats, preserving compatibility with previous versions.
- Renamed mainStaticElaboration.m as StaticInterface.m
- Moved main programs (C3D2MAT.m,ElaborationInterface.m, StaticInterface.m) to functions
- Moved internal functions in  private folders
- Renamed all readme.txt to README.md
- Modified y axis scale setting of envelope plots
- Modified data storage structure: added dynamicElaborations folder to group all the multiple executions of DataProcessing

BUG FIXES:

- Removed addition of mean values after EMG filtering
- Fixed units in EMGs plotting
- Fixed x label of envelope plots
- Fixed trial type identification for filtering cutoff definition
