Other Changes
- Added memory of last path when selecting files from graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
- Removed warning messages caused by the lack of subject's first and last names when loading a predefined acquisition.xml 

Bug Fixes
- When running a predefined elaboration.xml, the GUIs asked for a new elaboration identifier that won't be used.
Modified pop-up order in Elaboration and Static Interface: now user is asked to choose what to do 
(set a new elaboration, load and modify an old one or run one previously defined), and only after to insert 
the new elaboration identifier if it is the case.
