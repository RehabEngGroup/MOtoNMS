v. 1.0 (February 17, 2014) 

Initial Release


v. 1.1 (April 15, 2014)

NEW FEATURES:
- Support to Matlab 64 bit and multiplatform (C3D2MAT based on BTK)  
- EMG selection using Analog Labels from each C3D input file
- Shoulder, elbow, and wrist JC computation for static trials, and examples of setup files for Griffith University markerset
- Missing values for markers trajectories identified by NaN instead of 0 in .trc output files
      
CODE CHANGES:
- Added src/shared folder to store functions common to several steps
- Modified filtering of markers trajectories: they are filtered only when visible and only if they have no gaps (DataFiltering.m, ZeroLagButtFiltfilt.m)
- Modified filtering of GRF data from type 1 force platform: filtering is applied only to non zero values to avoid smoothing due to zero values 
 (data from force platform of type 1 are stored in C3D files after thresholding)
- Modified data interpolation: markers trajectories are interpolated only if gaps of consecutive frames are shorter than a fixed number 
  defined according to the video frame rate (DataInterpolation.m)
- Renamed replaceWithNans.m as replaceMissingWithNaNs.m
- Renamed matfiltfilt2.m as ZeroLagButtFiltfilt.m 
- Removed warning messages caused by the lack of subject's first and last names when loading a predefined acquisition.xml 
- Added last selected folder in text fields of graphical user interfaces (GUIs)

BUG FIXES:
- Modified transformation of COP coordinates from local to global reference system: translation added only for non zero values.
- User is not required to set a new identifier each time he/she load an already available elaboration.xml file as in version 1.0.  
- Changed the definition of the interval where markers are visible in replaceMissingWithNaNs.m (the definition of var 'index')
- Fixed the computation of the hip joint center (HJC) with the Harrington method (HJCHarrington.m)
