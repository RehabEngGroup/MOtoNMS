Introduction
============

MOtoNMS (matlab MOtion data elaboration TOolbox for
NeuroMusculoSkeletal applications) is a freely available toolbox that
aims at providing a complete tool for post-processing of movement data
for their use in neuromusculoskeletal software.

MOtoNMS has been design to be flexible and highly configurable, to
satisfy the requests of different research groups. Users can easily
setup their own laboratory and processing procedures, without
constraints in instruments, software, protocols, and methodologies,
everything without change in the MATLAB code.

MOtoNMS also improves the data organization, providing a clear
structure of input data and automatically generating output
directories.

The authors hope is that MOtoNMS may be useful to the research
community, reducing the gap between experimental data from motion
analysis and musculoskeletal simulation software, and uniforming data
processing methods across laboratories.

Please help us in maintaining and updating the toolbox. You can
provide feedback, comments, suggestions, and new modules using any of
the following channels:
