.. _`AcquisitionInterface`:

Acquisition Interface: describing your data
===========================================

During this step, a graphical user interface (GUI) will assist you in the creation of a file describing the acquisition session (``acquisition.xml``). This file must be created and included in the folder with the C3D data before running the next steps (:num:`Fig. #dataorg`). Furthermore, ``acquisition.xml`` is helpful when the data are shared among researchers as it allows to easily figure out all the details about the acquisition session.

The procedure is quite simple: you will go through a sequence of questions about the tracked subjects, people that collected the data, marker and EMG protocol, laboratory characteristics, etc.

The only tricky point is about the prefilled *setup files*. Information about the laboratory setup, markers and EMG protocols are usually common to several acquisitions. Therefore, instead of writing again and again the same values for each acquisition, these data are stored in setup files that can be selected from the GUI (:num:`Fig. #acquisition`). Thus, before running the Acquisition Interface you need to have already all the necessary :ref:`setup files <acquisitionSetupFiles>`. A few examples are available in the directories:

+ ``MOtoNMS\SetupFiles\AcquisitionInterface\Laboratories`` (Laboratory Configurations)
+ ``MOtoNMS\SetupFiles\AcquisitionInterface\MarkersProtocols`` (Markers Protocols)
+ ``MOtoNMS\SetupFiles\AcquisitionInterface\EMGsProtocols`` (EMG Protocols).

If you need a setup files not already included in the folders, you can add new setup files following the instruction in the sections Setup Files of each chapter.

.. _acquisition:

   Acquisition Interface schema. The user uses the Acquisition Interface GUI to create ``acquisition.xml``. Information about Laboratory configuration and Markers and EMG Protocols are stored in prefilled setup files to avoid reentering data common to multiple acquisitions.


How to run the program
----------------------

#. Set MATLAB path to ``src\AcquisitionInterface`` folder
#. Run ``mainAcquisitionInterface.m`` (this calls ``AcquisitionInterface.m``, the core program)
#. Answer to questions with the required information

**Output**: ``acquisition.xml`` file (saved in the ``InputData`` folder, :num:`Fig. #dataorg` - red).

At the beginning, the graphical interface asks whether the user wants to reload an ``acquisition.xml`` file. This is a useful functionality when the user wants to start with information stored in a file already available.

The resulting XML file is considered perfectly valid only when all the information is included (:ref:`Appendix B: Validation of Setup and Configuration Files <AppendixB>`). However, ``mainAcquisitionInterface.m`` only requires the data which are mandatory for the following processing allowing to skip some answers.


Please pay ATTENTION to the following IMPORTANT NOTES:

.. warning::

   + Input files folder MUST include the ``acquisition.xml`` file before running :ref:`Data Processing <DataProcessing>` and :ref:`Static Elaboration <StaticElaboration>` steps.
   + The ``acquisition.xml`` file is NOT required for :ref:`C3D2MAT <C3D2MAT>`, so you can run :ref:`Acquisition Interface <AcquisitionInterface>` and :ref:`C3D2MAT <C3D2MAT>` in any order.
   + Trials must be named as: *trial type* (``walking, running, fastwalking``,     etc.) + *sequential number*. Examples: ``walking1, fastwalking5``, etc.
   + The sequential number MUST not include any 0 in the front (write 1 not 001), otherwise errors may occur in the processing.
   + Trial names in the ``acquisition.xml`` MUST correspond to the actual input file names.
   + Gait trials gathered along the negative direction of motion are not currently supported: they may be processed without errors, but the results will not be correct. Please get in touch with the authors if you need to process trials along the negative direction.

.. _`acquisitionSetupFiles`:

Setup files
-----------

The following files speed up the process of compiling the ``acquisition.xml`` file that describes your acquisition session. When MOtoNMS has been already used in your laboratory to collect data with EMG and marker protocols do not go further: someone else should have already created these files. If you are not lucky and you have to write your own setup files, do not be scared: it is a simple procedure if you follow carefully the description in the this section.
Additionally, once you are done, you can check that the final XML file respect the required syntax with the validation procedure (see :ref:`Appendix B: Validation of Setup and Configuration Files <AppendixB>`).


.. _`lab`:

Laboratory
~~~~~~~~~~
This XML setup file describes the characteristics of the laboratory where data are collected. It has been introduced to avoid re-entering same data for each acquisition carried on in the same laboratory. Its name should uniquely identify the laboratory to whom it refers. Therefore, the best choice is to use a combination of laboratory name, department, university.

The following is an example of an XML setup file with information about the laboratory (available at SetupFiles\AcquisitionInterface\Laboratories\UNIPD.xml).

.. highlight:: xml

           </Rot>
         </FPtoGlobalRotations>
       </ForcePlatform>
     </ForcePlatformsList>
   </Laboratory>


The file must include the following:

#. **Orientation of the coordinate system** (``<CoordinateSystemOrientation>`` tag, line 4)

The coordinate system orientation refers to the global or laboratory coordinate system. We used the following convention:

+ 1st axis: direction of motion
+ 2nd axis: vertical axis
+ 3rd axis: right hand rule

with the assumption that the 1st axis has the same verse of OpenSim 1st axis, i.e. it should be the positive direction of motion (:num:`Fig. #convention`).
This convention requires that for any combination of the three axes (e.g. YZX, XZY, YXZ, etc...), the first axis must always be the direction of motion in your lab, the second one your vertical axis, and the last the one results from the right hand rule (:num:`Fig. #convention`). The adopted convention follows ISB recommendation [1]_. Line 4 shows an example of definition of coordinate system orientation.


.. _convention:

.. figure:: ../images/convention.png
   :align: center
   :width: 35%
   :figclass: align-center

   Convention for Coordinate System Orientation: example of interpretation.


Current version of MOtoNMS only manages data collected along the positive direction of motion. Gait trials gathered along the negative direction of motion may be processed without any output error, but the results will not be correct. Plese get in touch with the authors if you need to process trials in negative direction for a workaround suggestion.

#. **Type of force platforms** (``<Type>`` tag, lines 10 and 22)

Force platform (FP) type must be indicated because it influences output data (refer to `The C3D File Format User Guide <http://www.projects.science.uu.nl/umpm/c3dformat_ug.pdf>`_, by Motion Lab Systems, pag. 88 and to your force platform manual).

MOtoNMS recognizes and processes data from force platforms of type 1, 2, 3, and 4. Each plaform returns different data as shown in the following:

+ type 1: [Fx Fy FzPx PyMz]

+ type 2 and 4: [Fx Fy Fz Mx My Mz]

+ type 3: [Fx12 Fx34 Fy14 Fy23 Fz1 Fz2 Fz3 Fz4]

where F are the measured reaction forces, M the moments, and P the center of pressure (CoP) along the three directions. Numbers in type 3 platform refers to the sensors (refer to the `C3D File Format User Guide <http://www.projects.science.uu.nl/umpm/c3dformat_ug.pdf>`_ for additional information).


If your force platform includes a plate pad on the surface you need to correct CoP computation (please refer to `<http://www.kwon3d.com/theory/grf/pad.html>`_ for additional information). Future version of MOtoNMS will include this functionality. Please contact the authors for a workaround if you need it earlier.



#. **Rotation between the force platform and the global coordinates** (``<FPtoGlobalRotations>`` tag,  lines 12-17 and 24-33)

It is well known that each FP has its own coordinate system (:num:`Fig. #bertec`) and that C3D files store FP data in the corresponding FP coordinate system. Therefore,  the configuration file about the laboratory must provide also the transformation to rotate each FP reference system to the global one (lines 12-17 and 24-33).

.. _bertec:

   Bertec Plate Coordinate System ( from Bertec Force Plates Manual, version 1.0.0, March 2012, `<http://bertec.com/uploads/pdfs/manuals/Force%20Plate%20Manual.pdf>`_).


The XML example shows how to configure two Bertec force platforms. Their relative position and coordinate systems is shown in :num:`Fig. #orientation`.  Lines 12-17 (FP 1) and 24-33 (FP 2) list the required rotations. When more than one rotation is required, they are listed in sequence and estimated around moving axes (lines 24-33).

.. _labxml:




Markers Protocols
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Each marker protocol must be defined in a separate XML file. In the following an example of an XML  file with information about marker protocols  (available at SetupFiles\AcquisitionInterface\MarkersProtocols\UWA-Fullbody.xml)


.. _markersxml:

.. highlight:: xml
   :linenothreshold: 5

.. code-block:: xml
   :linenos:

   <MarkersProtocol>
     <Name>UWA-Fullbody</Name>
     <MarkersSetStaticTrials>LASI RASI LPSI RPSI ... </MarkersSetStaticTrials>
     <MarkersSetDynamicTrials>C7 RACR LPSI RPSH  ... </MarkersSetDynamicTrials>
   </MarkersProtocol>



In the example the markers set for both Static (``<MarkersSetStaticTrials>`` tag, line 3) and Dynamic Trials (``<MarkersSetDynamicTrials>`` tag, line 4) are defined. Names of the markers must match the labels used to identify the markers in the C3D files.

The labels of the markers cannot include spaces as this would prevent the creation of this configuration file.



.. _`emgsProtocols`:

EMGs Protocols
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


EMG protocol must be defined in an XML file. An example (available at SetupFiles\AcquisitionInterface\EMGsProtocols\UNIPD-15noside-left.xml) is shown in the following:


.. _emgprotocolxml:

.. highlight:: xml
   :linenothreshold: 5

.. code-block:: xml
   :linenos:

   <EMGsProtocol>
     <Name>UNIPD-15noside-left</Name>
     <MuscleList>
       <Muscle>Gluteus maximus</Muscle>
       <Muscle>Gluteus medius</Muscle>
       <Muscle>Tensor fasciae latae</Muscle>
       <Muscle>Sartorius</Muscle>
       .....
     </MuscleList>
     <InstrumentedLeg>Left</InstrumentedLeg>
   </EMGsProtocol>

The XML file includes information about the name of the protocol (line 2), the list of the muscles (lines 3-9) and the instrumented leg (line 10).
Muscles names (lines 4-8) MUST be those assigned during the acquisition session and, therefore, must agree with labels in the C3D files.

When EMG data are collected, the XML file must define the instrumented leg.  Depending on the leg with EMG sensors its value will be ``Right, Left, Both, None``. These are the only acceptable strings. When EMG signals are not collected during the acquisition session, this configuration file is not required, and the user just sets at 0 the number of EMG systems on the Acquisition Interface GUI (:num:`Fig. #emginterface`).
