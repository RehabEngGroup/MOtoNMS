In case of error, a useful function for debugging is ``save_to_base()``,
with input argument set to 1 (``save_to_base(1)``). It copies all
variables in the calling function to the base MATLAB workspace.This
allow to check theinternal variables from the MATLAB command prompt
after the calling function ends.
