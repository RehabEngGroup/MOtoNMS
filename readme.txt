                                  MOtoNMS

Matlab MOtion data elaboration TOolbox for NeuroMusculoSkeletal applications 
(MOtoNMS) is a a freely available toolbox that aims at providing a complete 
tool for post-processing of movement data for their use in neuromusculoskeletal 
software. MOtoNMS has been design to be flexible and highly configurable, 
to satisfy the requests of different research groups.  
Users can easily setup their own laboratory and processing procedures, 
without constraints in instruments, software, protocols, and methodologies, 
everything without change in the MATLAB code.  
MOtoNMS also improves the data organization, providing a clear structure of 
input data and automatically generating output directories. 

MOtoNMS is free software.  See the file license for copying conditions.
